### What I learned

my biggest challenge was to add font-family to my project. first i tried @font-face in css file, but it wasn't working so i google the stuff and ran into another solution. it was link tag which i used in my html page. but something was not working properly so i checked if this font is still on web or not, i was and i used the link which google font presented. eventually i solved my problem. but i am pretty sure i could've done it in fewer lines of code.
DO YOU HAVE GOT ANY IDEA HOW?
